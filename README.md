Evaluation of descriptive answer scripts is a time-consuming and subjective task in educational institutions. Existing automated grading systems are mostly limited to text-based inputs and cannot process handwritten answer sheets. This project proposes an intelligent answer evaluation system that accepts scanned images of student answer booklets as input. Optical Character Recognition is used to extract text from handwritten responses, which is then evaluated using natural language processing techniques. The system enables semantic comparison with reference material and supports partial marking. The proposed solution reduces evaluation time and improves grading consistency.
